## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Black Beans
- Drain and rinse black beans thoroughly
- Pat beans very dry with paper towels - excess moisture will make burgers soggy
- Add beans to a large mixing bowl
- Mash beans with a fork or potato masher
- Leave some chunks for texture - don't make it completely smooth
- You want about 75% mashed, 25% whole beans

### 2. Mix the Burger Mixture
- Add breadcrumbs to mashed beans
- Add finely diced onion (should be very small pieces)
- Add egg (or 2 1/2 tbsp beaten egg)
- Add chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper
- Mix everything together with your hands or a wooden spoon
- Mixture should hold together when squeezed
- If too wet, add 1-2 tbsp more breadcrumbs
- If too dry, add 1 tsp water

### 3. Form the Patties
- Divide mixture into 3 equal portions (about 1/2 cup each)
- Shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick and 4 inches wide
- Make patties slightly wider than your buns (they won't shrink like meat)
- Press down firmly so they hold together
- Make a small indent in the center with your thumb (prevents bulging)

### 4. Chill the Patties
- Place patties on a plate lined with parchment paper
- Cover with plastic wrap
- Refrigerate for 15 minutes (helps them firm up and hold together during cooking)
- Can be refrigerated up to 24 hours ahead

### 5. Cook the Burgers
- Heat 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat
- When oil is shimmering, add patties (cook in batches if needed)
- Cook for 4-5 minutes on first side without moving them
- Patties should develop a golden-brown crust
- Flip carefully with a wide spatula
- Cook for 4-5 minutes on second side
- Burgers are done when heated through and crispy on both sides
- Don't press down on burgers while cooking (keeps them moist)

### 6. Toast the Buns
- In the last minute of cooking, add buns cut-side down to the same skillet
- Toast for 30-60 seconds until lightly golden

### 7. Assemble the Burgers
- Place lettuce on bottom bun
- Add burger patty
- Top with tomato slice and red onion
- Add pickles if desired
- Spread condiments on top bun
- Close burger and serve immediately

## Notes & Tips

### Fractional Ingredients:
- **Egg:** Use 1 small egg OR measure exactly 2 1/2 tbsp from a beaten egg
- Why precision matters: Too much egg makes burgers mushy, too little and they fall apart

### Binding Tips:
- Key to success is getting the right moisture level
- If mixture is too wet: Add more breadcrumbs 1 tbsp at a time
- If mixture is too dry: Add water 1 tsp at a time
- Test by squeezing a small amount - it should hold together without crumbling

### Cooking Methods:

**Pan-Frying (Recommended):**
- Gives best crispy exterior
- Use medium heat (not high - they can burn)
- Don't crowd the pan

**Baking:**
- Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)
- Place patties on parchment-lined baking sheet
- Brush tops with olive oil
- Bake 10 minutes, flip, brush again, bake 10 more minutes
- Less crispy but healthier option

**Air Frying:**
- Preheat air fryer to 375°F
- Brush patties with oil
- Cook 8 minutes, flip, cook 5-7 more minutes

### Make-Ahead & Storage:

**Uncooked Patties:**
- Refrigerate: Up to 24 hours (cover tightly)
- Freeze: Up to 3 months (separate with parchment, store in freezer bag)
- Cook from frozen: Add 2-3 minutes per side

**Cooked Burgers:**
- Refrigerate: Up to 3 days in airtight container
- Freeze: Up to 2 months
- Reheat: In skillet over medium heat or microwave

### Customization Ideas:
- Add 2 tbsp salsa for southwestern flavor
- Mix in 2 tbsp corn for texture
- Add 1/4 tsp smoked paprika for smoky flavor
- Top with avocado or guacamole
- Use chipotle mayo for spicy kick
- Add a slice of pepper jack cheese (melt during last minute of cooking)

### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve with sweet potato fries
- Pair with side salad
- Offer chips and salsa
- Make slider-sized for appetizers (divide into 6 small patties)
