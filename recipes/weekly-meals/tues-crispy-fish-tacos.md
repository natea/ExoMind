## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Slaw (Can be done ahead)
- Mix shredded purple and green cabbage in a bowl
- Add mayonnaise, lime juice, cumin, salt, and pepper
- Toss well to combine
- Refrigerate while preparing fish (can be made up to 2 hours ahead)

### 2. Make the Batter
- In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and pepper
- Add cold beer or sparkling water
- Whisk until smooth - batter should have the consistency of heavy cream
- Don't overmix; a few small lumps are fine

### 3. Heat the Oil
- Pour 2 inches of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven
- Heat oil to 350°F (175°C) - use a thermometer for accuracy
- Oil is ready when a drop of batter sizzles immediately

### 4. Prepare the Fish
- Cut fish into 9 strips (approximately 3 strips per fillet if using 3 fillets)
- Pat fish completely dry with paper towels - this is crucial for crispy batter
- Season lightly with salt

### 5. Fry the Fish
- Working in batches of 3-4 pieces, dip fish in batter
- Let excess batter drip off
- Carefully lower into hot oil
- Fry for 4-5 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and crispy
- Transfer to paper towel-lined plate
- Maintain oil temperature at 350°F between batches

### 6. Warm the Tortillas
- Heat corn tortillas in a dry skillet over medium-high heat for 30 seconds per side
- OR hold directly over gas flame for a few seconds per side
- Wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm

### 7. Assemble the Tacos
- Place a generous spoonful of slaw on each tortilla
- Top with one piece of fried fish
- Add pico de gallo or diced tomatoes
- Add avocado slices
- Garnish with fresh cilantro
- Serve with lime wedges on the side
- Add hot sauce to taste

## Notes & Tips

### Fractional Ingredients:
- **3/4 avocado:** Use 3/4 of a medium avocado (save remaining 1/4 for another use or extra topping)
- The scaling is precise for 3 people

### Oil Temperature:
- Keep oil at 350°F throughout cooking
- If oil gets too hot, fish will burn outside but be raw inside
- If oil is too cool, fish will absorb oil and be greasy
- Let oil return to temperature between batches

### Fish Selection:
- Best choices: Cod, tilapia, halibut, mahi-mahi
- Use fresh fish if possible, or completely thawed frozen fish
- Fish should be firm and smell fresh, not fishy

### Make-Ahead Tips:
- Slaw can be made 2 hours ahead and refrigerated
- Batter is best made fresh, but can be made 30 minutes ahead
- Fish should be fried just before serving for maximum crispiness

### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve 3 tacos per person
- Offer extra lime wedges
- Provide hot sauce options (sriracha, cholula, salsa verde)
- Pair with Mexican rice or black beans as a side

### Storage:
- Leftover fried fish: Store in airtight container in fridge for 1 day
- Reheat in oven at 375°F for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness
- Leftover slaw: Store covered in fridge for up to 2 days
