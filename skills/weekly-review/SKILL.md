## Troubleshooting

### "I don't have time for weekly review"
- Start with 30-minute sprint version
- Focus on: inbox, next-actions, calendar
- Expand gradually as habit forms

### "My lists are overwhelming"
- Do initial "brain dump" session
- Process in batches (20-30 min chunks)
- Use "2-minute rule" liberally

### "I fall behind between reviews"
- Add daily mini-reviews (5-10 min)
- Use capture tools more frequently
- Set calendar reminder 3 days before weekly review

### "System feels rigid"
- Customize phases to your needs
- Skip sections that don't apply
- Focus on what gives you clarity

## Notes for Claude

When user triggers weekly review:

1. **Start with context check**: "When was your last weekly review? How are you feeling about your system?"

2. **Guide through phases**: Present each phase clearly, don't rush

3. **Be flexible**: Skip or abbreviate phases based on user needs

4. **Use integrations**: Actually call MCP tools for calendar, email, tasks

5. **Capture everything**: Store all processed items properly

6. **Generate summary**: Create completion report with metrics

7. **Schedule next**: Set reminder for next weekly review

8. **Celebrate**: Acknowledge completion - this is hard work!
