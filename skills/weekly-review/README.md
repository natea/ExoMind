# Weekly Review Skill

## Overview

Comprehensive GTD (Getting Things Done) weekly review to maintain system integrity, clear your mind, and plan effectively. The cornerstone habit for keeping Life OS running smoothly.

## Purpose

This skill helps you:
- Empty all collection points (inbox zero)
- Update all GTD lists (next actions, projects, waiting for, someday/maybe)
- Review past week calendar and capture follow-ups
- Preview next 2 weeks and prepare
- Reflect on wins, challenges, and learnings
- Plan next week's priorities and time blocks

## When to Use

- **Weekly**: Same day/time each week (Friday afternoon or Sunday evening recommended)
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours uninterrupted
- **Frequency**: Non-negotiable - this is the system's heartbeat

## The 6-Phase GTD Weekly Review

### Phase 1: Get Clear (Empty Collection Points)

**Goal**: Process all inboxes to zero

1. **Physical Inbox**
   - Process mail, notes, business cards
   - Capture items into GTD system

2. **Digital Inbox** (`inbox.md`)
   - Review all items
   - Process each: What is it? Is it actionable?
   - Route to appropriate list

3. **Email Inbox**
   - Use Gmail MCP integration
   - Process to inbox zero
   - Convert to actions/projects

4. **WhatsApp/Messages**
   - Check for captured tasks/ideas
   - Process voice notes
   - Clear conversation capture points

### Phase 2: Get Current (Update Lists)

**Goal**: All lists are accurate and up-to-date

1. **Next Actions** (`next-actions.md`)
   - Still relevant? Delete if not
   - Still next action? Move to projects if multi-step
   - Context accurate? (@home, @work, etc.)
   - Mark completed items as DONE

2. **Projects** (`projects.md`)
   - What's the successful outcome?
   - Is there a next action defined?
   - Still active? Move to someday if stalled
   - Archive if completed (celebrate! ðŸŽ‰)

3. **Waiting For** (`waiting.md`)
   - Still waiting? Check if received
   - Need follow up? Create next action
   - How long waiting? Escalate if needed
   - Mark completed and remove

4. **Someday/Maybe** (`someday.md`)
   - Ready to activate? Move to projects
   - Still interested? Delete if not
   - Need incubation? Set reminder
   - Add new ideas

### Phase 3: Review Calendar

**Goal**: Capture commitments and prepare for upcoming events

1. **Past Week Review** (7 days back)
   - Any follow-up actions from meetings?
   - Any commitments made to capture?
   - Lessons learned to note?
   - Incomplete items to process?

2. **Next 2 Weeks Preview** (14 days ahead)
   - Any prep work needed?
   - Travel arrangements required?
   - Materials to prepare?
   - Create next actions for preparation

### Phase 4: Get Creative (Big Picture)

**Goal**: Connect daily actions to higher horizons

Review GTD Horizons:
- **Runway**: Current actions - what needs attention?
- **10,000 ft**: Projects - which are most important?
- **20,000 ft**: Areas of Focus - each area healthy?
- **30,000 ft**: 1-2 Year Goals - progress on track?
- **40,000 ft**: 3-5 Year Vision - still aligned?
- **50,000 ft**: Life Purpose - actions align with values?

### Phase 5: Plan Next Week

**Goal**: Set clear direction for upcoming week

1. **Weekly Priorities**
   - Top 3 outcomes for the week
   - Key focus areas
   - Weekly metrics/goals

2. **Time Blocking**
   - Block focus time for priorities
   - Schedule deep work sessions (2-4 hour blocks)
   - Plan admin/email time
   - Set daily planning time

### Phase 6: Clean Up & Complete

**Goal**: System is pristine and ready

1. **System Maintenance**
   - Archive completed items
   - Clean up formatting
   - Update dates/contexts
   - Ensure all lists organized

2. **Reflection Questions**
   - What went well last week?
   - What could be improved?
   - What did I learn?
   - What am I grateful for?

- Celebrate progress

## Common Issues

**"I don't have time for weekly review"**
- Start with 30-minute sprint version
- Focus on: inbox, next-actions, calendar
- Expand gradually

**"My lists are overwhelming"**
- Do initial "brain dump" session
- Process in batches (20-30 min chunks)
- Use "2-minute rule" liberally

**"I fall behind between reviews"**
- Add daily mini-reviews (5-10 min)
- Use capture tools frequently
- Set mid-week check-in
