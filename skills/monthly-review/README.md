# Monthly Review Skill

## Overview

Comprehensive monthly reviews that aggregate insights from weekly reviews, track goal progress, assess life areas, and plan for the next month. Transforms weekly data into actionable monthly insights through a 4-phase process.

## Purpose

This skill helps you:
- Aggregate patterns from 4-5 weekly reviews
- Measure progress on quarterly OKRs and monthly goals
- Check in on all life areas from latest assessment
- Identify trends, wins, and recurring challenges
- Plan priorities and focus areas for next month
- Build momentum through pattern recognition

## When to Use

- **End of Month**: Last day for comprehensive monthly review
- **Emergency Review**: When significant course correction needed
- **Quarterly Alignment**: Month 3 review includes quarterly assessment

## The 4-Phase Monthly Review Process

### Phase 1: COLLECT - Gather Monthly Data (10-15 min)

**Objective**: Aggregate all weekly reviews and relevant data

- Pull all weekly reviews for the month
- Gather goal tracking from active plan
- Collect life area data from latest assessment
- Review calendar highlights and energy patterns

### Phase 2: ANALYZE - Identify Patterns (15-20 min)

**Objective**: Find patterns, trends, and insights

- Win pattern detection (what repeated?)
- Challenge pattern analysis (what's systemic?)
- Completion rate calculations
- Energy and productivity patterns
- Life area momentum tracking

### Phase 3: ASSESS - Goal & Life Progress Check (15-20 min)

**Objective**: Evaluate progress against goals and life vision

- OKR progress scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Monthly goals review (completed/in progress/not started)
- Life area check-in (compare to last assessment)
- Time allocation vs. priorities
- Habit consistency tracking

### Phase 4: PLAN - Next Month Strategy (20-25 min)

**Objective**: Design next month's focus and priorities

- Select month theme
- Define top 3-5 priorities
- Adjust habits (keep/modify/drop/add)
- Plan process improvements
- Create challenge mitigation plans
- Pre-plan calendar
- Set success metrics

## Pattern Analysis Examples

### Win Patterns
- **Consistent Winners**: Appeared in 2+ weekly reviews
- **Life Areas with Momentum**: Trending upward
- **Success Factors**: What contributed to wins

### Challenge Patterns
- **Recurring Challenges**: Appeared in 2+ weeks
- **Life Areas Needing Attention**: Declining areas
- **Systemic Issues**: Underlying problems

### Completion Metrics
- **Weekly Reviews**: X/4 weeks (goal: 100%)
- **Daily Planning**: X/20 days (goal: 80%+)
- **Habit Streaks**: Percentage for each habit
- **Goal Progress**: Percentage for each OKR

## OKR Scoring Guide

```
0.0-0.3: Major challenges, need significant adjustment
0.4-0.6: Moderate progress, some adjustment needed
0.7-0.8: IDEAL - Stretch goal achieved
0.9-1.0: Too easy, set higher targets next time
```

## Monthly Review Template Structure

```markdown
# Monthly Review: October 2025

## üìä MONTH SNAPSHOT
- Overall Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4/5)

## üéØ PHASE 1: COLLECTED DATA
- Weekly Review Summary (all weeks)
- Goal Progress Snapshot
- Life Area Scores

## üîç PHASE 2: PATTERN ANALYSIS
- Win Patterns
- Challenge Patterns
- Completion Metrics
- Life Area Momentum

## ‚úÖ PHASE 3: GOAL & LIFE ASSESSMENT
- OKR Progress (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Monthly Goals Review
- Life Area Comparison

- Habit Consistency Report

## üöÄ PHASE 4: NEXT MONTH PLAN
- Month Theme
- Top 3-5 Priorities

- Success Metrics
```

## Month Theme Examples

- **"Building Momentum"**: After a strong month
- **"Course Correction"**: After facing challenges
- **"Deep Focus"**: On a critical goal
- **"Balance Restoration"**: After imbalance
- **"Experimentation"**: Trying new approaches
- **"Consolidation"**: Solidifying gains

## Integration Points

### Input Files
- `memory/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` (4-5 weekly reviews)
- `memory/plans/active-plan.md` (OKRs and goals)
- `memory/assessments/latest.md` (Life area scores)

### Output File
- `memory/monthly/YYYY-MM.md` (Monthly review)

### Updates
- Active plan with new priorities
- Calendar with time blocks
- Habit tracking adjustments

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Completeness**
- All 4 phases executed thoroughly
- Data from all weekly reviews aggregated
- All life areas and goals addressed

‚úÖ **Insight Quality**
- Patterns identified with evidence
- Root causes analyzed
- Clear trends established

‚úÖ **Actionability**
- Specific next month priorities
- Measurable success metrics
- Concrete process improvements
- Realistic habit adjustments

‚úÖ **Momentum**
- Celebrates wins and progress
- Addresses challenges constructively
- Builds on successful patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Schedule 60-90 minutes**: Don't rush this process
2. **Quiet environment**: Minimize distractions for reflection
3. **Be honest**: Face challenges and setbacks truthfully
4. **Celebrate wins**: Recognize progress, even small wins
5. **Look for patterns**: This is the key insight source
6. **Be specific**: Vague plans lead to vague results
7. **Realistic priorities**: 3-5 max, linked to goals
8. **Update as you go**: Don't wait until month end to track
9. **Compare trends**: Month-to-month comparison is valuable
10. **Act immediately**: Update plans and calendar right after review

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå Skipping monthly reviews (momentum loss)
‚ùå Only reviewing at quarter end (too infrequent)
‚ùå Focusing only on what went wrong (demotivating)
‚ùå Setting too many priorities (dilution)
‚ùå Not connecting to weekly/daily systems (disconnect)
‚ùå Ignoring patterns (missing insights)
‚ùå Not updating active plans (stale goals)
‚ùå Being vague about next month (no direction)
‚ùå Forgetting to celebrate wins (burnout risk)
‚ùå Rushing through phases (shallow insights)

## Quarterly Integration

On **Month 3** of each quarter, add:
- 90-day progress review
- OKR final scores
- Next quarter theme
- Quarterly adjustments
