The Quarterly Review skill helps you:

1. **Review 90 Days** - Synthesize 3 monthly reviews into quarterly insights
2. **Score OKRs** - Rate all objectives on 0.0-1.0 scale
3. **Identify Patterns** - Find 90-day trends in productivity, wellbeing, relationships
4. **Plan Next Quarter** - Set strategic OKRs for Q+1
5. **Celebrate Wins** - Acknowledge major accomplishments
6. **Refine Goals** - Adjust based on what worked/didn't work

## Quarterly Review Schedule

| Quarter | Months | Review Date | Plan Next Quarter |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | Mar 28-31 | Apr 1-7 (Q2 OKRs) |
| Q2 | Apr-Jun | Jun 28-30 | Jul 1-7 (Q3 OKRs) |
| Q3 | Jul-Sep | Sep 28-30 | Oct 1-7 (Q4 OKRs) |
| Q4 | Oct-Dec | Dec 28-31 | Jan 1-7 (Q1 OKRs) |

## The 5 Phases

### Phase 1: COLLECT (Days 1-2)
Gather all data:
```bash
# Monthly reviews
cat memory/monthly/2025-01.md
cat memory/monthly/2025-02.md
cat memory/monthly/2025-03.md

# Life assessment
cat memory/assessments/2025-Q1.md

# OKRs
cat memory/goals/2025-Q1-okrs.json

# Weekly reviews (for context)
cat memory/weekly/2025-W*.md
```

### Phase 2: SCORE (Day 3)
Rate all OKRs:
```javascript
// Scoring guide
0.0-0.3: Failed
0.4-0.6: Partial Success
0.7-0.9: Success
1.0: Complete Success

// Example
{
  "kr": "Ship MVP to 100 users",
  "target": 100,
  "actual": 87,
  "score": 0.87,
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Phase 3: REFLECT (Days 4-5)
Answer deep questions:
- What were your 3 biggest wins?
- What patterns led to success?
- What challenges emerged?
- What would you do differently?
- What did you learn about yourself?

### Phase 4: PLAN (Day 6)
Set Q+1 OKRs:
```json
{
  "quarter": "2025-Q2",
  "theme": "Sustainable Growth",
  "objectives": [
    {
      "objective": "Scale product to $10k MRR",
      "keyResults": [
        "Increase users from 87 to 250",
        "Improve conversion from 15% to 30%",
        "Achieve $10k MRR"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 5: DOCUMENT (Day 7)
Save comprehensive review:
```bash
# Generate final document
bash skills/quarterly-review/generate-document.sh

# Store in memory
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit \
  --file "memory/quarterly/2025-Q1.md" \
  --memory-key "swarm/user/quarterly-review/2025-Q1"
```

## OKR Scoring System

### Scoring Formula
```javascript
function calculateScore(target, actual) {
  if (actual >= target) return 1.0;
  return Math.min(actual / target, 1.0);
}

// Example
calculateScore(100, 87) // 0.87
calculateScore(10, 12) // 1.0 (exceeded)
calculateScore(50, 20) // 0.4 (partial)
```

### Grade Scale
| Score Range | Grade | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| 0.9-1.0 | A | Exceptional quarter |
| 0.8-0.89 | B+ | Strong quarter |
| 0.7-0.79 | B | Good quarter |
| 0.6-0.69 | C+ | Acceptable quarter |
| 0.5-0.59 | C | Mixed results |
| <0.5 | D/F | Needs major adjustment |

### Objective Scoring
```javascript
// Average all key results
const objectiveScore = average(keyResults.map(kr => kr.score));

// Example
O1: [0.87, 1.0, 0.65] â†’ 0.84 (B+)
O2: [1.0, 0.7, 1.0] â†’ 0.90 (A)
Quarter: [0.84, 0.90] â†’ 0.87 (A)
```

## Pattern Analysis Framework

### SWOT Analysis
```markdown
**Strengths**: What consistently worked
- Morning routine (90-day streak)
- Weekly reviews (13/13 completed)
- Exercise habit (52/48 sessions)

**Weaknesses**: What didn't work
- Evening screen time (3+ hours)
- Social connection (declined 30%)
- Reading goal (60% completed)

**Opportunities**: Emerging positives
- New skill gaining traction
- Side project showing promise
- Network expanding rapidly

**Threats**: Warning signals
- Burnout risk (energy declining)
- Relationship strain (less time together)
- Financial pressure (runway shortening)
```

### Trend Analysis
```javascript
const trends = {
  productivity: {
    month1: 7.5,
    month2: 8.2,
    month3: 7.8,
    trend: 'stable',
    pattern: 'consistent'
  },
  wellbeing: {
    month1: 8.0,
    month2: 7.5,
    month3: 6.8,
    trend: 'declining',
    pattern: 'gradual'
  }
};
```

## Next Quarter Planning

### Theme Selection
Choose 1-2 themes:
- "Build Sustainable Systems"
- "Deepen Relationships"
- "Financial Foundation"
- "Creative Expression"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Be more productive" (not measurable)

### Key Results
**Format**: [Metric] from [X] to [Y]

**Example**:
```json

  "keyResults": [
    "Increase users from 87 to 250",
    "Improve conversion from 15% to 30%",

### Workflow
```
Month 3 Week 4:

```

## Success Metrics
- âœ“ Review completed within 7 days of quarter end
- âœ“ All OKRs scored with clear rationale

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does a quarterly review take?**
A: Plan 7-10 hours spread over 7 days (1-1.5 hours per day)

A: Use weekly reviews as input, or start with partial data

**Q: Can I skip the life assessment?**
A: Yes, but it provides valuable context for goal setting

**Q: How do I score subjective goals?**
A: Use 0-10 self-ratings, convert to 0.0-1.0 scale

## Next Steps

After completing quarterly review:
1. Schedule Q+1 kickoff ritual
