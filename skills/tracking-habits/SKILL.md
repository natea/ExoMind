# Tracking Habits Skill

## Purpose
Systematic habit tracking and streak management to build consistent behaviors that support your goals and values. Track completion, identify patterns, maintain motivation through streaks, and integrate with daily/weekly reviews.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Habit Definition and Setup
- Define habits with clear success criteria
- Set frequency (daily, weekly, specific days)
- Identify keystone habits (high-impact behaviors)
- Establish habit triggers and context
- Set difficulty level (adjust as needed)
- Link habits to goals and values

### 2. Completion Tracking
- Simple yes/no completion marking
- Partial completion tracking (0-100%)
- Skip vs fail distinction (intentional vs forgot)
- Note field for context/obstacles
- Time of completion logging
- Mood/energy correlation tracking

### 3. Streak Management
- Current streak calculation
- Best streak (personal record)
- Total completions count
- Consistency percentage
- Breaking point analysis
- Recovery tracking (getting back on track)

### 4. Pattern Recognition
- Best days/times for habits
- Common failure triggers
- Success enablers identification
- Seasonal patterns
- Energy correlation
- Environment impact analysis

### 5. Habit Stacking
- Link new habits to existing ones
- Identify stacking opportunities
- Suggest optimal habit order
- Create routine bundles
- Morning/evening ritual building

### 6. Accountability and Motivation
- Streak visualization
- Milestone celebrations
- Progress snapshots
- Comparison to past self
- Commitment devices
- Social accountability options

### 7. Integration with Life OS
- Daily log habit checkboxes
- Weekly review habit assessment
- Monthly habit audit
- Quarterly habit evolution
- Annual habit transformation review

## Habit Framework

### Habit Types
```yaml
identity_based:
  - Focus on who you want to become
  - "I am a person who exercises daily"
  - Builds intrinsic motivation
  - More sustainable long-term

outcome_based:
  - Focus on specific results
  - "I want to lose 10 pounds"
  - Provides clear target
  - Risk of motivation loss after achievement

process_based:
  - Focus on the system/routine
  - "I go to gym at 7am Mon/Wed/Fri"
  - Most reliable for consistency
  - Recommended default approach
```

### Frequency Options
```yaml
daily:
  description: Every single day
  examples: [meditation, journaling, exercise]
  difficulty: High consistency requirement

weekday:
  description: Monday through Friday
  examples: [deep work block, morning routine]
  difficulty: Medium, weekends as break

specific_days:
  description: Custom days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
  examples: [gym, therapy, batch cooking]
  difficulty: Medium, regular but not daily

weekly:
  description: At least once per week
  examples: [meal planning, weekly review]
  difficulty: Lower pressure, flexible timing

custom:
  description: X times per week/month
  examples: [3x/week cardio, 2x/month date night]
  difficulty: Flexible but requires tracking
```

### Difficulty Levels
```yaml
trivial:
  effort: Minimal (1-2 minutes)
  friction: Nearly zero
  examples: [drink water, make bed]
  success_rate: 90%+

easy:
  effort: Low (5-10 minutes)
  friction: Very low
  examples: [stretch, gratitude journal]
  success_rate: 75-90%

moderate:
  effort: Medium (15-30 minutes)
  friction: Some obstacles to overcome
  examples: [workout, read, meditate]
  success_rate: 50-75%

challenging:
  effort: High (30-60 minutes)
  friction: Significant commitment
  examples: [write for hour, deep work]
  success_rate: 30-50%

intense:
  effort: Very high (60+ minutes)
  friction: Major lifestyle change
  examples: [train for marathon, learn language]
  success_rate: <30%
```

## Breaking Point Analysis

### Understanding Why Streaks Break
```yaml
common_breaking_points:
  travel:
    frequency: "35% of breaks"
    prevention: "Create travel-specific habit versions"
    example: "Hotel room workout vs gym"

  illness:
    frequency: "20% of breaks"
    prevention: "Lower standards when sick"
    example: "5-min gentle stretch vs 30-min workout"

  special_events:
    frequency: "15% of breaks"
    prevention: "Plan ahead, accept flexibility"
    example: "Skip morning routine for wedding weekend"

  lost_motivation:
    frequency: "15% of breaks"
    prevention: "Review 'why', adjust difficulty"
    example: "Remember health scare that inspired habit"

  environmental_change:
    frequency: "10% of breaks"
    prevention: "Rebuild cues in new environment"
    example: "Moving to new apartment disrupts routine"

  other:
    frequency: "5% of breaks"
```

### Break Recovery Protocol
```yaml
immediate_actions:
  - "Don't dwell on the break"
  - "Identify what went wrong"
  - "Restart immediately (today if possible)"
  - "Lower standard if needed"
  - "Update environment/triggers"

recovery_tracking:
  - Days to restart after break
  - Success rate in first week back
  - Adjustments made to habit
  - Obstacles removed

resilience_building:
  - "Each recovery makes you stronger"
  - "Breaking isn't failing, not restarting is"
  - "Track recovery time, aim to decrease it"
```

## Habit Evolution

### Difficulty Adjustment
```yaml
start_easy:
  initial_habit: "Exercise 5 minutes daily"
  success_rate: 95%
  duration: 2 weeks

increase_gradually:
  updated_habit: "Exercise 10 minutes daily"
  success_rate: 85%
  duration: 2 weeks

reach_target:
  updated_habit: "Exercise 30 minutes daily"
  success_rate: 75%
  duration: ongoing

rule_of_thumb: "Only increase difficulty when success rate >80% for 2+ weeks"
```

### Habit Retirement
```yaml
when_to_retire:
  - Habit fully integrated (automatic)
  - No longer serves your goals
  - Life circumstances changed
  - New priority habit needed

how_to_retire:
  - Move to "maintenance tracking" (weekly check)
  - Archive habit data for future reference
  - Celebrate the transformation achieved
  - Make room for new growth area
```

4. Bedtime: Implement phone charging outside bedroom
```

### Quarterly Habit Evolution (1 hour)
```markdown
## Q4 2025 Habit Transformation Review

### Established Habits (Graduated)
These are now automatic, no longer need daily tracking:
- ✓ Making bed (97% for 6 months)
- ✓ Morning coffee + journaling (92% for 4 months)
- ✓ Workout clothes prep the night before (automatic trigger)

### Consistent Habits (Keep Tracking)
- Exercise 30 min: 85% (was 65% in Q3)
- Meditation 10 min: 82% (was 70% in Q3)
- Bedtime by 10:30: 71% (was 55% in Q3)

### Struggling Habits (Need Intervention)

  → Action: Trying audiobooks during commute instead
- No social media before noon: 52% (was 60% in Q3)
  → Action: Delete apps from phone, web-only access

### New Habits to Test
Based on keystone habit research and current goals:
1. Cold shower (morning energy + discipline)
2. Gratitude practice (mental health + perspective)
3. Weekly sabbath (rest + creativity)
