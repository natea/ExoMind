# Goal Setting Skill

## Overview

Creates actionable SMART goals and OKRs from life assessment insights, breaking them down into quarterly objectives, monthly milestones, and weekly actions. Ensures goals are aligned with personality, values, and life circumstances.

## Purpose

This skill helps you:
- Create SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals
- Structure goals using OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework
- Break down quarterly goals into monthly milestones and weekly actions
- Align goals with personality assessment and life areas
- Track progress systematically

## When to Use

- **After Life Assessment**: Use assessment results to set priorities
- **Start of Quarter**: Create quarterly OKRs (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Goal Adjustments**: During monthly/quarterly reviews
- **New Life Goals**: When circumstances or priorities change

## SMART Goals Framework

### Criteria Validation

Each goal must be:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous objective
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success metrics
- **Achievable**: Realistic given current resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with personality and values
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline or timeframe

### Example Transformation

```
❌ VAGUE: "Get better at managing time"

✅ SMART: "Reduce weekly unplanned work by 50%
          (from 10 hours to 5 hours) by implementing
          time-blocking system by end of Q1 2025"
```

## OKR Structure

### Objective (Qualitative)
- Inspirational and motivating
- Directional rather than specific
- Time-bound (typically quarterly)
- Answers "What do we want to achieve?"

### Key Results (Quantitative)
- 3-5 measurable outcomes per objective
- Specific numeric targets
- Progress trackable
- Answers "How will we know we're succeeding?"

### OKR Example

```
OBJECTIVE: Build a sustainable daily wellness routine

Key Results:
├─ KR1: Exercise 5 days/week for 30+ minutes (Apple Health)
├─ KR2: Achieve 7+ hours sleep on 90% of nights (sleep app)
├─ KR3: Complete 10-min meditation daily for 80% of days (Calm)
└─ KR4: Home-cooked meals 5x/week (food log)

Timeline: Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar)
```

## Quarterly OKR Template

```markdown
# Q1 2025 Goals (Jan-Mar)

## OBJECTIVE 1: [Inspirational Statement]
**Why:** Connection to life assessment insights
**Timeline:** Q1 2025

### Key Results:
1. [Measurable outcome 1] - Current: X | Target: Y
2. [Measurable outcome 2] - Current: X | Target: Y
3. [Measurable outcome 3] - Current: X | Target: Y

### Monthly Milestones:
**January:**
- [ ] Milestone 1
- [ ] Milestone 2

**February:**
- [ ] Milestone 3
- [ ] Milestone 4

**March:**
- [ ] Milestone 5
- [ ] Milestone 6

### Weekly Actions (Week 1):
- [ ] Action 1 (2 hours) - Due: Mon
- [ ] Action 2 (1 hour) - Due: Wed
- [ ] Action 3 (3 hours) - Due: Fri
```

## OKR Scoring Guide

```
0.0-0.3: Major challenges, need significant adjustment
0.4-0.6: Moderate progress, some adjustment needed
0.7-0.8: IDEAL - Stretch goal achieved (aim for this)
0.9-1.0: Too easy, set higher targets next time
```

## Review & Adjustment Process

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)
1. Check completed actions
2. Update progress on key results
3. Plan next week's actions
4. Adjust if blocked

### Monthly Review (30 minutes)
1. Score milestone completion
2. Analyze what's working/not working
3. Adjust monthly targets if needed
4. Celebrate wins

### Quarterly Review (60 minutes)
1. Score each OKR (0.0-1.0)
2. Reflect on learnings
3. Update assessment if personality shifted
4. Set next quarter's OKRs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Too Many Goals
**Problem**: Overwhelm and lack of focus
**Solution**: Limit to 3-5 quarterly objectives

### ❌ Vague Objectives
**Problem**: Can't measure progress
**Solution**: Apply SMART criteria strictly

### ❌ Unrealistic Targets
**Problem**: Demotivation from constant failure
**Solution**: Set stretch but achievable targets (0.7-0.8 score)

### ❌ No Review Process
**Problem**: Goals forgotten after creation
**Solution**: Weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews mandatory

### ❌ Disconnected from Reality
**Problem**: Goals ignore current life circumstances
**Solution**: Factor in time, energy, resources realistically
