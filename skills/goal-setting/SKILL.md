# Goal Setting Skill

## Overview
Creates actionable SMART goals and OKRs from personality assessment insights, breaking them down into quarterly objectives, monthly milestones, and weekly actions.

## When to Use
- After completing personality assessment
- At the start of each quarter
- When creating new life goals
- During monthly/quarterly reviews
- When adjusting goals based on progress

## Skill Behavior

### Input Processing
1. Analyzes personality assessment results
2. Identifies key areas for growth
3. Reviews current life circumstances
4. Considers user preferences and constraints
5. Links goals to assessment insights

### Goal Creation Process
1. **Vision Alignment**: Connects goals to assessment areas
2. **SMART Validation**: Ensures goals meet all criteria
3. **OKR Structuring**: Defines objectives and key results
4. **Timeframe Planning**: Sets quarterly, monthly, weekly targets
5. **Action Breakdown**: Creates specific next steps

## SMART Goals Framework

### Criteria Validation
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous objective
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success metrics
- **Achievable**: Realistic given current resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with personality and values
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline or timeframe

### Example SMART Goal
```
❌ VAGUE: "Get better at managing time"
✅ SMART: "Reduce weekly unplanned work by 50% (from 10 hours to 5 hours)
          by implementing time-blocking system by end of Q1 2025"
```

## OKR Structure

### Objective (Qualitative)
- Inspirational and motivating
- Directional rather than specific
- Answers "What do we want to achieve?"
- Time-bound (quarterly)

### Key Results (Quantitative)
- 3-5 measurable outcomes per objective
- Specific numeric targets
- Progress trackable
- Answers "How will we know we're succeeding?"

### OKR Example
```
OBJECTIVE: Build a sustainable daily wellness routine
├─ KR1: Exercise 5 days/week for 30+ minutes (track via Apple Health)
├─ KR2: Achieve 7+ hours sleep on 90% of nights (track via sleep app)
├─ KR3: Complete 10-minute meditation daily for 80% of days (track via Calm)
└─ KR4: Prepare and eat home-cooked meals 5x/week (track via food log)
```

```

### Step 5: Breakdown Planning

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Too Many Goals
**Problem:** Overwhelm and lack of focus
**Solution:** Limit to 3-5 quarterly objectives

### ❌ Vague Objectives
**Problem:** Can't measure progress
**Solution:** Apply SMART criteria strictly

### ❌ Unrealistic Targets
**Problem:** Demotivation from constant failure
**Solution:** Set stretch but achievable targets

### ❌ No Review Process
**Problem:** Goals forgotten after creation
**Solution:** Weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews

### ❌ Disconnected from Reality
**Problem:** Goals ignore current life circumstances
**Solution:** Factor in time, energy, resources

## Review & Adjustment Process

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)
1. Check completed actions
2. Update progress on key results
3. Plan next week's actions
4. Adjust if blocked

### Monthly Review (30 minutes)
1. Score milestone completion
2. Analyze what's working/not working
3. Adjust monthly targets if needed
4. Celebrate wins

### Quarterly Review (60 minutes)
1. Score each OKR (0.0-1.0)
2. Reflect on learnings
3. Update assessment if personality shifted
4. Set next quarter's OKRs
