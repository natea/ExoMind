# Daily Planning Skill

## Description
Structured daily planning workflow combining morning intention-setting with evening reflection to maximize productivity while maintaining energy and wellbeing. Helps you start each day with clarity and end with learning.

## When to Use
- **Morning**: Start your day (ideally 6-8am) before diving into work
- **Evening**: End your workday (ideally 5-7pm) with reflection
- **Mid-day**: Quick check-in when feeling overwhelmed or scattered

## Morning Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Set Your Daily Intention
Ask yourself:
```
What is my primary focus for today?
What would make today feel successful?
What energy/mindset do I want to bring to today?
```

Record your intention in 1-2 sentences. This becomes your north star for the day.

### Step 2: Identify Top 3 Priorities
Using the Eisenhower Matrix framework:
- **Priority 1**: Most important + urgent (must complete today)
- **Priority 2**: Important but less urgent (significant progress needed)
- **Priority 3**: Important work (move forward meaningfully)

**Critical Rule**: Maximum 3 priorities. If everything is a priority, nothing is.

**Selection Criteria:**
- Does this align with my weekly/monthly goals?
- Will this create momentum or reduce friction?
- What's the cost of NOT doing this today?

### Step 3: Review Your Schedule
**Time Blocking Suggestions:**

```
MORNING BLOCK (9am-12pm)
- Reserve for Priority 1 (deep work)
- Minimize meetings/interruptions
- Peak energy hours

AFTERNOON BLOCK (1pm-4pm)
- Priority 2 + collaborative work
- Meetings, calls, communications
- Moderate energy tasks

LATE DAY BLOCK (4pm-6pm)
- Priority 3 + administrative tasks
- Planning, organizing, cleanup
- Lower energy acceptable
```

**Energy Management:**
- Schedule hardest work during your peak energy hours
- Build in 10-15 min breaks between blocks
- Protect at least one 90-min deep work session
- Include buffer time (20% of day) for unexpected items

### Step 4: Prepare Your Environment
Quick setup checklist:
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs/apps
- [ ] Set phone to focus mode
- [ ] Prepare workspace (water, tools ready)
- [ ] Review any dependencies/blockers
- [ ] Set first timer/focus session

## Evening Reflection Workflow

### Step 1: Document Your Wins
**Capture at least 3 wins from today:**
- What got completed?
- What progress was made?
- What did you learn?
- What went better than expected?

**Why this matters:** Training your brain to notice progress builds momentum and motivation.

### Step 2: Reflection Questions
Answer these briefly (2-3 sentences each):

**Effectiveness:**
```
Did I accomplish my top 3 priorities? If not, what got in the way?
What was my most productive hour today? Why?
What should I stop/start/continue doing?
```

**Energy & Wellbeing:**
```
What was my energy level like? (1-10 scale)
When did I feel most energized? Most drained?
Did I take breaks and manage my energy well?
```

**Learning & Growth:**
```
What's one thing I learned today?
What would I do differently tomorrow?
What am I grateful for from today?
```

### Step 3: Tomorrow Preview
Quick preparation for tomorrow:
- Review calendar for upcoming commitments
- Identify 1-2 potential priorities for tomorrow
- Note any prep work needed tonight
- Clear any mental clutter (brain dump)

### Step 4: Append to Daily Log
Your daily log entry should include:

```markdown
## [Date] - Daily Review

### Morning Intention
[Your intention for the day]

### Top 3 Priorities
1. [Priority 1] - ✓/✗
2. [Priority 2] - ✓/✗
3. [Priority 3] - ✓/✗

### Wins Today
- [Win 1]
- [Win 2]
- [Win 3+]

### Energy Level: [X/10]
Peak hours: [time range]
Low hours: [time range]

### Key Learning
[One insight from today]

### Tomorrow Focus
[Preview of top 1-2 items]

### Gratitude
[What you're grateful for]
```

## Task Prioritization Framework

When choosing priorities, apply these filters:

### 1. Impact Filter
- **High Impact**: Moves major goals forward significantly
- **Medium Impact**: Necessary but incremental progress
- **Low Impact**: Nice to have, minimal goal alignment

### 2. Urgency Filter
- **Urgent**: Deadline today/tomorrow, blocking others
- **Soon**: Deadline this week, needs progress
- **Later**: No immediate deadline, strategic work

### 3. Energy Match Filter
- **High Energy Required**: Complex problem-solving, creative work, important decisions
- **Medium Energy**: Communication, collaboration, routine tasks
- **Low Energy**: Administrative, organizing, simple execution

### 4. Priority Matrix

```
        HIGH IMPACT              LOW IMPACT
       ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
URGENT │  DO FIRST (P1)  │  DELEGATE/      │
       │  Deep focus     │  QUICK WINS     │
       ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
LATER  │  SCHEDULE (P2)  │  ELIMINATE/     │
       │  Strategic work │  DEFER          │
       └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## Energy Management Guidelines

### Protect Your Peak Hours
- **Identify your peak**: When do you have most mental clarity?
- **Guard fiercely**: No meetings during peak if possible
- **Use for Priority 1**: Your most important work only

### Build Recovery Time
- **90-min cycles**: Work in focused sprints, then break
- **Micro-breaks**: 5 min every hour (walk, stretch, water)
- **Lunch away**: Step away from desk for real recovery

### Energy Drains to Minimize
- Context switching between unrelated tasks
- Meetings without clear agendas/outcomes
- Email/Slack reactivity mode
- Decision fatigue (automate/template routine choices)

### Energy Boosters
- Morning movement (even 10 minutes)
- Natural light exposure
- Deep work progress (momentum builds energy)
- Social connection (brief positive interactions)

## Tips for Success

### Morning Planning (5-10 minutes)
- Do this BEFORE checking email/messages
- Write it down (don't just think it)
- Be realistic with time estimates
- Include transition/buffer time

### Throughout the Day
- Review priorities at start of each block
- Track actual vs. planned time (learn your patterns)
- Celebrate small wins as they happen
- Adjust flexibly when needed

### Evening Reflection (5-10 minutes)
- Do this BEFORE shutting down work
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- Be honest but compassionate with yourself
- Use insights to improve tomorrow

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works well with:**
- **Weekly Review**: Priorities align with weekly goals
- **Meal Planning**: Schedule meal prep in time blocks
- **Grocery Shopping**: Add shopping to appropriate energy block
- **Recipe Finding**: Plan recipe research during low-energy times

## Example Daily Log Entry

```markdown

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't narrow down to 3 priorities"**
→ Ask: "If I could only complete ONE thing today, what would it be?" Start there.

**"My schedule is all meetings"**
→ Audit: Are all meetings necessary? Can any be async? Can you block even one 90-min slot?

**"I never hit my priorities"**
→ Track: For one week, record why not. Usually reveals patterns (over-estimation, interruptions, wrong priorities).

**"Evening reflection feels like homework"**
→ Simplify: Just answer "What worked? What didn't? What's tomorrow's #1?" That's enough.

## Success Metrics

Track these weekly:
- **Priority completion rate**: % of top 3 completed
- **Energy awareness**: Can you predict your peak hours?
- **Win documentation**: Did you capture wins daily?
- **Learning application**: Did reflections improve next day?

**Goal**: 70%+ priority completion rate with maintained/improved energy levels.

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfect execution of a rigid plan. It's intentional focus on what matters most, with built-in learning to improve continuously. Be flexible, be kind to yourself, and trust the process.
