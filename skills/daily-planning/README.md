# Daily Planning Skill

## Overview

Structured daily planning workflow combining morning intention-setting with evening reflection to maximize productivity while maintaining energy and wellbeing. Start each day with clarity and end with learning.

## Purpose

This skill helps you:
- Set clear daily intentions and priorities
- Plan your day with energy management in mind
- Review and reflect on daily progress
- Build momentum through consistent wins
- Learn from each day to improve tomorrow

## When to Use

- **Morning** (6-8am): Start your day before diving into work
- **Evening** (5-7pm): End your workday with reflection
- **Mid-day**: Quick check-in when feeling overwhelmed or scattered

## Two Core Workflows

### 🌅 Morning Planning (5-10 minutes)

**1. Set Daily Intention**
- What is my primary focus today?
- What would make today feel successful?
- What energy/mindset do I want to bring?

**2. Identify Top 3 Priorities**
- Priority 1: Most important + urgent (must complete)
- Priority 2: Important but less urgent (significant progress)
- Priority 3: Important work (meaningful movement)

**3. Review Schedule & Block Time**
- Morning block (9am-12pm): Priority 1 deep work
- Afternoon block (1pm-4pm): Priority 2 + collaborative work
- Late day block (4pm-6pm): Priority 3 + admin tasks

**4. Prepare Environment**
- Close unnecessary tabs/apps
- Set phone to focus mode
- Prepare workspace (water, tools)
- Review dependencies/blockers

### 🌙 Evening Reflection (5-10 minutes)

**1. Document Wins**
- What got completed?
- What progress was made?
- What did I learn?
- What went better than expected?

**2. Reflection Questions**
- Did I accomplish my top 3 priorities? If not, why?
- What was my most productive hour?
- What should I stop/start/continue?
- Energy level today? (1-10)

**3. Tomorrow Preview**
- Review calendar for upcoming commitments
- Identify 1-2 potential priorities
- Note any prep work needed
- Clear mental clutter (brain dump)

**4. Append to Daily Log**
- Morning intention
- Top 3 priorities (✓/✗)
- Wins, energy level, key learning
- Tomorrow focus, gratitude

## Task Prioritization Framework

### Impact + Urgency Matrix

```
        HIGH IMPACT         LOW IMPACT
       ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
URGENT │  DO FIRST (P1)  │  DELEGATE/      │
       │  Deep focus     │  QUICK WINS     │
       ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
LATER  │  SCHEDULE (P2)  │  ELIMINATE/     │
       │  Strategic work │  DEFER          │
       └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Energy Matching

- **High Energy Required**: Complex problems, creative work, decisions
- **Medium Energy**: Communication, collaboration, routine tasks
- **Low Energy**: Administrative, organizing, simple execution

## Energy Management Guidelines

### Protect Your Peak Hours
- Identify when you have most mental clarity
- Guard fiercely - no meetings if possible
- Use for Priority 1 only

### Build Recovery Time
- 90-min work cycles with breaks
- 5 min micro-breaks every hour
- Lunch away from desk

### Energy Boosters
- Morning movement (even 10 minutes)
- Natural light exposure
- Deep work progress (momentum builds energy)
- Brief positive social interactions

### Energy Drains to Minimize
- Context switching between unrelated tasks
- Meetings without clear agendas
- Email/Slack reactivity mode
- Decision fatigue

## Success Metrics

Track weekly:
- **Priority completion rate**: % of top 3 completed (goal: 70%+)
- **Energy awareness**: Can you predict your peak hours?
- **Win documentation**: Did you capture wins daily?
- **Learning application**: Did reflections improve next day?

## Integration with Life OS

- **Weekly Review**: Priorities align with weekly goals
- **Meal Planning**: Schedule meal prep in time blocks
- **Grocery Shopping**: Add to appropriate energy block
- **Processing Inbox**: Block time for email processing

## Tips for Success

### Morning Planning
- Do BEFORE checking email/messages
- Write it down (don't just think it)
- Be realistic with time estimates
- Include buffer time (20% of day)

### Throughout Day
- Review priorities at start of each block
- Track actual vs. planned time
- Celebrate small wins as they happen
- Adjust flexibly when needed

### Evening Reflection
- Do BEFORE shutting down work
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- Be honest but compassionate
- Use insights to improve tomorrow

## Common Issues

**"I can't narrow down to 3 priorities"**
→ Ask: "If I could only complete ONE thing today, what would it be?"

**"My schedule is all meetings"**
→ Audit: Are all necessary? Can any be async? Block even one 90-min slot?

**"I never hit my priorities"**
→ Track: For one week, record why not. Usually reveals patterns.

**"Evening reflection feels like homework"**
→ Simplify: Just answer "What worked? What didn't? What's tomorrow's #1?"

## Quick Start

```bash
# Morning routine
1. Set intention (1 sentence)
2. Pick top 3 priorities
3. Block time on calendar
4. Prepare environment

# Evening routine
1. Document 3+ wins
2. Answer reflection questions
3. Preview tomorrow
4. Append to daily log
```
