# Weekly Meal Planning Assistant

## Overview

This Skill helps create comprehensive, personalized weekly meal plans tailored to individual or family needs. It gathers essential information through a structured questionnaire, then generates a complete meal plan with an organized grocery list. The skill ensures meals align with dietary restrictions, preferences, schedules, nutritional goals, and budget constraints.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- A user wants meal ideas that fit specific dietary requirements
- Someone is looking to save time or money through better meal planning
- A user needs meals planned around a busy schedule

## Core Functionality

Ask the following questions to understand the user's needs. You may ask them all at once or conversationally, depending on the context:

2. **What are the ages of the people eating?** (adults, children, teens, elderly)
3. **Will anyone else be eating during this time period?** (guests, extended family)

#### Dietary Needs & Restrictions
4. **Do you have any food allergies?** (e.g., gluten, dairy, nuts, soy, eggs, fish, shellfish)
5. **Do you have any food intolerances or sensitivities?**
6. **Are there any health conditions to consider?** (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, celiac)
7. **What type of diet do you follow or prefer?** (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, keto, paleo, Mediterranean, low-carb, whole foods, omnivore)
8. **Do you eat meat, fish, or dairy? If so, how often?**

#### Food Preferences
9. **What foods do you absolutely dislike or refuse to eat?**
10. **What foods do you love and want included more often?**
11. **Do you enjoy ethnic cuisines?** (e.g., Asian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Indian)
12. **What types of meals do you prefer?** (e.g., soups, salads, wraps, casseroles, one-pot meals, stir-fries)

#### Goals & Priorities
13. **What is your primary goal for this meal plan?** (e.g., weight loss, weight maintenance, muscle gain, managing health conditions, increasing energy, saving time, saving money)
14. **Rank your top priorities:** (quick prep time, budget-friendly, nutritious, family-friendly, variety)

#### Schedule & Time
15. **What does your weekly schedule look like?** Are there specific days when you're busier and need quicker meals?
16. **How much time can you dedicate to cooking each day?**
17. **How many days per week do you plan to cook or prep?**
18. **How would you rate your cooking skill level?** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
19. **Are you interested in batch cooking or meal prepping ahead of time?**

#### Meals & Eating Patterns

## Examples of Good Output

### Example 1: Busy Family
*Context: Family of 4, two working parents, kids ages 6 and 9, limited time weeknights, budget-conscious*

The plan should include:
- 30-minute meals on weeknights
- One slow cooker meal for the busiest day
- Weekend meal that provides planned leftovers
- Kid-friendly options with hidden vegetables
- Breakfast ideas that can be grabbed quickly
- Snack list focused on whole foods

### Example 2: Single Professional, Health-Focused
*Context: 1 person, fitness enthusiast, high-protein diet, enjoys cooking on weekends, needs portable lunches*

The plan should include:
- Batch-cooked proteins for the week
- Grain bowls and salads for portable lunches
- Higher protein content in each meal
- Pre/post-workout snack options
- Sunday meal prep schedule
- Minimal food waste strategies

### Example 3: Vegetarian Couple, Adventurous Eaters
*Context: 2 adults, vegetarian, enjoy trying new cuisines, moderate budget, intermediate cooking skills*

The plan should include:
- Diverse ethnic cuisines (Thai, Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican)
- Plant-based protein variety (tofu, tempeh, legumes, seitan)
- Interesting grain options (farro, quinoa, bulgur)
- Date-night worthy meal for weekend
- Creative leftover ideas

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Conflicting requirements:** If dietary restrictions conflict with preferences, prioritize health restrictions and suggest alternatives
- **Unrealistic expectations:** If time/budget don't align with goals, gently adjust expectations and explain trade-offs
- **Missing information:** If critical details are missing, ask follow-up questions before generating the plan
- **Unusual diets:** For specialized diets (FODMAP, AIP, specific medical diets), acknowledge limitations and suggest consulting a professional if needed

## Iterative Refinement

After presenting the initial plan:
- **Ask for feedback:** "How does this look? Would you like me to adjust anything?"
- **Offer modifications:** "I can make this meal vegetarian/faster/cheaper if you prefer"
- **Explain reasoning:** "I chose this meal for Tuesday because you mentioned needing something quick"
- **Adapt based on response:** If user wants changes, revise specific meals or the entire plan as needed
