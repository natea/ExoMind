# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions and answers about using Life OS effectively.

## Getting Started

### Q: Do I need to use all features from day one?

**A:** Absolutely not! Start with just daily logging for the first week. Add weekly reviews in week 2. Gradually incorporate other features as you become comfortable. Life OS is designed to grow with you.

**Recommended progression:**
- Week 1: Daily logs only
- Week 2: Add weekly review
- Week 3: Add inbox processing
- Week 4: Conduct first assessment
- Month 2: Add goal setting
- Month 3: Add integrations

---

### Q: How much time does Life OS require daily?

**A:** Minimum commitment:
- **Daily**: 5-10 minutes (morning planning + evening reflection)
- **Weekly**: 30-45 minutes (Sunday review)
- **Monthly**: 1-2 hours (comprehensive review)
- **Quarterly**: 2-3 hours (assessment + planning)

Most users find they save more time than they invest through better planning and fewer distractions.

---

### Q: What if I miss a day (or week)?

**A:** Missing days is completely normal! Life OS is designed to be forgiving:

1. **Missing a daily log**: Just resume tomorrow, no need to backfill
2. **Missing a weekly review**: Do a quick review when you return
3. **Missing a month**: Don't try to catch up, start fresh
4. **The key**: Get back on track quickly, don't quit entirely

Remember: Consistency over perfection. A simple log after a break is better than no log at all.

---

### Q: I'm overwhelmed by the assessment. Help?

**A:** The full assessment can feel daunting. Try these approaches:

**Option 1: Quick Assessment**
```bash
npm run life-os:assess --quick
```
Only asks 1-2 questions per life area (5 minutes).

**Option 2: Gradual Assessment**
Assess one life area per day over 8 days.

**Option 3: Voice Recording**
Record voice responses and transcribe later.

**Option 4: Partner Session**
Do it with a friend or partner for accountability.

The first assessment is hardest. It gets easier each time.

---

## Daily Use

### Q: What's the best time for daily planning?

**A:** It depends on your chronotype:

**Morning Larks**: Plan first thing (6-7 AM)
- Fresh mind
- Before distractions start
- Sets intention for day

**Night Owls**: Plan evening before (9-10 PM)
- Day's events fresh in mind
- Less rushed in morning
- Sleep on priorities

**Experiment** to find what works for you. Most important: Be consistent.

---

### Q: I can't stick to my daily plan. What's wrong?

**A:** Common causes and solutions:

**1. Overly Ambitious Plans**
- **Problem**: Scheduling 12 hours of work in 8 hours
- **Solution**: Plan for 60% of available time, leave 40% buffer

**2. No Buffer Time**
- **Problem**: Back-to-back scheduled items
- **Solution**: Add 15-min transitions between tasks

**3. Ignoring Energy**
- **Problem**: Hard tasks during low-energy times
- **Solution**: Match task difficulty to your energy patterns

**4. External Chaos**
- **Problem**: Other people's emergencies
- **Solution**: Block "protected time" on calendar

**5. Unrealistic Priorities**
- **Problem**: Everything is urgent
- **Solution**: Limit to TOP 3 priorities only

---

### Q: How do I handle interruptions?

**A:** Use the **Capture-Defer-Redirect** method:

1. **Capture**: Quick note in inbox
2. **Defer**: "Can this wait until [time]?"
3. **Redirect**: "Who else could handle this?"

For true emergencies: Adjust your plan in the moment, reflect on it during evening review.

---

### Q: My daily logs feel repetitive. Is that okay?

**A:** Yes! Repetition often means:
- You've found what works
- Consistent habits are forming
- Life is stable (good thing!)

Spice it up occasionally:
- Add weekly reflection questions
- Try voice recordings
- Include photos or sketches
- Experiment with gratitude practices

But repetitive is fine if it's working.

---

## Weekly Reviews

### Q: Weekly reviews take too long (2+ hours). Normal?

**A:** First few reviews take longer as you establish the practice. Should stabilize at 45-60 minutes.

**Speed it up:**

1. **Daily Maintenance** (5 min/day)
   - Keep inbox current
   - Log as you go
   - Update tasks immediately

2. **Template Use**
   - Don't start from scratch
   - Use prompts and checklists
   - Copy last week's format

3. **Time Boxing**
   - Set 45-minute timer
   - Focus on high-value reflections
   - Skip perfectionism

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Process similar items together
   - One-touch decisions
   - No analysis paralysis

If still taking 2+ hours after a month, you might be overthinking. Weekly reviews are about patterns, not perfection.

---

### Q: What if nothing significant happened this week?

**A:** Every week has value, even "boring" ones:

Review anyway:
- **Consistency**: Was routine maintained?
- **Habits**: Which habits succeeded?
- **Relationships**: Small moments of connection?
- **Learning**: What did you read/watch/discuss?
- **Rest**: Did you get adequate recovery?

Sometimes maintaining stability IS the achievement.

---

### Q: Should I review every life area weekly?

**A:** No! Weekly reviews should focus on:
- Active goals
- Recent events
- Upcoming week
- Current challenges

Full life area assessment is quarterly. Weekly is more tactical.

---

## Goals and Planning

### Q: How many goals should I have?

**A:** **Active goals: 3-5 maximum**

Why so few?
- Focus enables progress
- Too many goals = no goals
- Quality over quantity
- Better to achieve 3 than fail at 10

**Framework:**
- 1-2 career/work goals
- 1-2 health/personal goals
- 1 relationship/life balance goal
- Keep others in "someday" list

---

### Q: I set goals but never achieve them. Why?

**A:** Most goal failure comes from:

**1. Outcome Focus (Not Process)**
- **Wrong**: "Lose 20 pounds"
- **Right**: "Exercise 4x/week for 12 weeks"

**2. No System**
- **Wrong**: "Get promoted"
- **Right**: "Ship 2 major projects + monthly 1-on-1s with boss"

**3. Too Ambitious**
- **Wrong**: "Write novel in 30 days"
- **Right**: "Write 500 words daily for 90 days"

**4. No Tracking**
- **Wrong**: Set goal, forget it
- **Right**: Weekly progress review

**5. No Accountability**
- **Wrong**: Keep goal private
- **Right**: Share with accountability partner

**Solution**: Start with process goals you can control, not outcome goals you can't.

---

### Q: Can I change goals mid-quarter?

**A:** Yes! Goals should serve you, not imprison you.

**Valid reasons to change:**
- Life circumstances changed
- Goal no longer aligns with values
- Different goal became more important
- Current goal no longer motivating

**How to change:**
1. Document why you're pivoting
2. Update in Life OS
3. Set new SMART goal
4. Adjust weekly plans
5. Don't feel guilty

Flexibility is strength, not weakness.

---

### Q: How do I balance improvement goals with maintenance?

**A:** Use the **70/30 rule**:
- 70% maintenance (keep what's working)
- 30% improvement (new goals)

**Example quarter:**
- Maintain: Exercise 3x/week, daily logging, date nights
- Improve: Learn Spanish, increase income, write blog

Don't neglect maintenance while chasing improvement.

---

## Integrations

### Q: Which integration should I set up first?

**A:** Priority order:

1. **Todoist** (if you use task management)
   - Most immediate value
   - Syncs across devices
   - Quick setup

2. **Google Calendar** (if you're calendar-driven)
   - Essential for planning
   - Time blocking support
   - Meeting integration

3. **WhatsApp** (if you want mobile access)
   - Quick capture
   - Daily briefings
   - On-the-go logging

4. **Gmail** (if email overwhelms you)
   - Email to task
   - Inbox zero support
   - Later in your journey

Start with one, master it, then add others.

---

### Q: My Todoist tasks aren't syncing. Help!

**A:** Troubleshooting checklist:

```bash
# 1. Test connection
npm run todoist:test

# 2. Check API token
# In .env file, verify TODOIST_API_TOKEN is correct

# 3. Force sync
npm run todoist:sync --force

# 4. Check for conflicts
npm run todoist:conflicts

# 5. View logs
npm run todoist:logs
```

**Common issues:**
- Expired API token → regenerate in Todoist settings
- Network issues → check internet connection
- Project mapping → verify projects exist in Todoist
- Duplicate tasks → run deduplication

Still stuck? Check logs for specific error messages.

---

### Q: Can I use Life OS without any integrations?

**A:** Absolutely! Life OS works perfectly standalone.

**Integrations are optional enhancements:**
- Use if you want unified system
- Skip if you prefer separate tools
- Add later if needs change

Core Life OS features don't require integrations.

---

### Q: WhatsApp integration isn't working. What to do?

**A:** Check these:

```bash
# 1. Test WhatsApp connection
npm run whatsapp:test

# 2. Verify QR code authentication
npm run whatsapp:auth --refresh

# 3. Check settings
# Verify WHATSAPP_MCP_ENABLED=true in .env

# 4. Test sending
npm run whatsapp:send --test
```

**Common issues:**
- QR code expired → re-authenticate
- WhatsApp Web disconnected → reconnect on phone
- Phone offline → ensure phone has internet
- Rate limiting → wait and retry

---

---

Reflect on yesterday in the morning.

**Option 2: Micro-Logging**
Quick voice notes throughout day:
```
"Just finished project meeting - went well"
"Feeling low energy after lunch"

```

**Option 3: Weekend Batch**
Reflect on whole week during Sunday review.

**Option 4: Audio Journaling**
Record voice memos while commuting.

**Option 5: Partner Processing**

---

### Q: How do I make Life OS a habit, not a chore?

**A:** Shift mindset from obligation to investment:

**Reframe:**
- Not: "I have to do this"
- But: "I get to do this"

**Find meaning:**

**A:** No! Life OS is for holistic life management:

**Beyond productivity:**
- Relationships and connection
- Health and wellbeing
- Personal growth
- Life satisfaction
- Purpose and meaning
- Balance and rest

Productivity is ONE of eight life areas, not the focus.

---

### Q: Isn't all this tracking and planning stressful?

**A:** It can be if misused. Healthy approach:

**Do:**
- Track to learn patterns

- Review to celebrate progress
- Use as tool for clarity

**Don't:**
- Obsess over metrics

- Let it create anxiety

**Rule of thumb:** If Life OS increases stress, you're doing it wrong. It should bring clarity and peace.

---

### Q: How is Life OS different from other productivity systems?

**A:** Key differences:

**Life OS:**

- Proprietary
- May cost money

Life OS combines best practices from many systems while remaining flexible.

---

### Q: What if my partner/family thinks this is obsessive?

**A:** Address concerns:

**1. Share the Why**
- Not about control
- About intentional living
- Reduces stress
- More present with family

**2. Show, Don't Tell**
- Let results speak
- More available
- Less stressed
- Better planning

**3. Include Them**
- Shared goals
- Family planning
- Relationship tracking
- Collaborative reviews

**4. Set Boundaries**
